# Code Quiz

## Introduction

Here's a timed quiz done in jQuery. It will ask multiple choice questions with a total of 15 seconds per question for the timer. Every incorrect answer will subtract 15 seconds from the timer. There is also a high scores feature that stores score data via localStorage. The user can choose to clear the score data.
